# FriendFinder

So... I think most of the work is done, however comparison logic in apiRoutes is incomplete.  I got stuck getting the new data of the survay post (the info from survay.html) to match the data in friendArray in friends.js.  This prevented the comparison of the 2 from working.  the console throws a 500 error that neither I nor my tutor could solve.

Once this is solved, the next steps would be:
	1. send the best match back to the browser via the useage of modal.
	2. add the new data to the friendsArray in friends.js.
	3. make the interface a little nicer.
	4. deploy to Heroku..

Unfortunatly, time has run out and this is what I got...
